# Modules Naming Standards
DRAFT v. 0.9.0

This document sums up and proposes naming conventions for Puppet modules.

They are not supposed to enforce any module's design logic, so alternative options and common patterns are outlined for different modules' structure and functionallity.
 
A Standard Module is not required to have all of the names and variables proposed here, but if some parameters and class names are provided that offer the same function, they should be called as proposed in these conventions.

## Modules names and structure
A module has the **name of the managed application**, system function or resource it manages.

Using the **package name** as module name is not a good practice as package names differ among distributions, so a **common name** should be preferred instead.

Example:

Bad naming:

```puppet
bind9::params
postgresql-8::service
mysql5::install
```
Good naming:

```puppet
bind::params
postgresql::service
mysql::install
```
In case of doubt, already established namings and common sense are the rule.

Resources can be managed in the main class and/or in subclasses.

When a module has subclasses current standard de-facto names apply:

**class::params** - (May) contain modules internal parameters and defaults

**class::client** - Manages only the client

**class::server** - Manages the server installation.

**class::install** - Manages only the installation of 'class'

**class::service** - Manages only the service of 'class'

**class::config** - Manages the configuration of 'class'

**class::repo** - Manages eventual extra repos needed for the class

Examples:

```puppet
postfix::params
openssh::client
openssh::server
elasticsearch::install
postfix::service
postfix::config
mongodb::repo
```
In the cases that 'class' has different sub-applications that can be configured separatedly or different daemons for each of its parts, subdirectories and subclass might be used to represent each part.

Example:

```puppet
bacula::params
bacula::config
```
For the server application (bacula-director):

```puppet
bacula::server
bacula::server::install
bacula::server::service
bacula::server::config
```
or

```puppet
bacula::director
bacula::director::install
bacula::director::service
bacula::director::config
```
being the latter the preferred naming option:

```puppet
bacula::director::install
bacula::client::service
bacula::storage::config
bacula::console::install
```

### Common defines
The following defines are reserved for common use cases:
module::conf     # Define to manage secondary configuration files for the module
module::instance # Define that manages single different instances of the module's application

Example:
```puppet
tomcat::instance
memcached::instance
postfix::conf
```


## Parameters for classes and defines
A module may have many different parameters, related to the specific application it manages, but in order to comply with *stdmod* guides, some parameters should have a common naming among modules.

Here are considered **only common parameters** that might be used in any module.

The general **[prefix_]resource_attribute** pattern is followed, to map consistently class parameters with resources attributes.

The use of a prefix should be avoided for classes or defines that manage a single resource main configuration file, package or service (ie: **package_ensure** is preferred instead of main_package_ensure).

For additional resources a prefix is used denoting the resource itself (ie: **client_package**, **server_package**).

If there are parameters as the ones defined before in subclasses or defines, omonimous resource names are removed.

For example, a module can expose parameters in the main class like :

```puppet
class openssh (
  $service_ensure = disabled,
  $service_enable = false,
  ) { … }

```
or/and have them in short form, without resource name, in the relevant subclass: 

```puppet
class openssh::service (
  $ensure = disabled,
  $enable = false,
  ) { … }
```

More generally, in defines, the shorter version is preferred (for the single or the main resource managed by the define, for other resources standard names with prefixes apply).

### Variables validation and sanitation

Variables should be validated and sanitized whenever possible, taking in account these guide lines:

* If a variable has a finite number of possible values, the passed value should be checked against
  this list, or an error should be raised.
* The sanitized value should be stored in a variabled prefixed with *bool_* plus the name
  of the original variable when sanitizing booleans. Ie.:

```puppet
$bool_listen = any2bool($listen)
```

* The sanitized value should be stored in a variabled prefixed with *real_* plus the name
  of the original variable when sanitizing variables with any number of known options. Ie:


```puppet
$real_version = $postgresql::version ? {
  '' => $postgresql::bool_use_postgresql_repo ? {
    true  => '9.2',
    false => $::operatingsystem ? {
...

```

* The sanitized value should be stored in a variabled prefixed with *manage_* plus the name
  of the original variable when sanitizing variables affecting control of resources. Ie:


```puppet
$manage_package = $postgresql::bool_absent ? {
  true  => 'absent',
  false => 'present',
}

```
